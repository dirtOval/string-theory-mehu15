going to write brainstorming concepts here.

IDEAS:
-little gremlin that tries to come up with words. pet game.
-black hole themed shmup
-a robot tries to make guitar music sound good. makes various pitches
 and asks: "is this any good?"
-some kind of strategy game? lmao it's all i want.

we are going with the gremlin concept

so what are we doing?

we need a little guy in a room with a bed,
a computer, and a table for eating.

he needs to be working, will randomly come up with
words, ask if they are words.

can be switched to write poetry.

to do list:
-gremlin. has several states.
  -eating -
  -sleeping
  -working
-food meter. ticks down over time, replenished by eating
-sleep meter. ticks down over time, replenished by sleeping
-work. will randomly attempt to string together characters. will randomly ask player if they made a word.
 if they succeeded, will add to dictionary
-dictionary. can view list of words with timestamp.

i dont want to do this project lol.

what if i ditch the theory part and just make a spider that spins webs and tries not to die.

-procedurally generate web like structures
-make flies randomly fly around
-if a fly gets caught the spider eats it.
-the string part comes in bc you enter a string to act as the seed for the web + level
